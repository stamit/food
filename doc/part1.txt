      Comments: The total value is the sum of

          of the fact that tryptophan is also
          chemically aromatic.

<AAE8>

          amino acids because they are essential for
          infants.

<AAE10B>amino acids, total essential; includes
               the eight basic essential amino acids
               plus cystine and tyrosine
      Unit: mg
      Comments: Cystine and tyrosine are
          included in this definition of
          essential amino acids because of
          their sparing effects on the
          requirements for methionine and
          phenylalanine respectively.

      Unit: mg
      Comments: Arginine and histidine are
          included in this definition of

          are essential for infants.  Cystine
          and tyrosine are included because of

          reported, they are usually the sum of
          whatever amino acids were analysed for
          that particular food.  Consequently, this
          term is not precisely defined.  Additional

<ENERA>
     energy, gross; determined by direct

          expressed in kilocalories instead of the
          default unit of kilojoules. However, if
          expressed in kilocalories, kcal must be
          explicitly stated with the secondary
          tagname <UNIT/>.
      Note: It would be confusing and would imply
          additional information that does not exist
          if two <ENERA> values, i.e., one expressed
          in kilocalories and the other expressed in

          calculated from the other using the

          Consequently, one or the other should be

          conversion factors used to calculate
          this energy value from the proximate
          quantities.  The conversion factors
          may be described by a keyword, or the
          conversion factors may be listed
          using secondary tagnames within
          <ENERC>.  (More than one <ENERC>
          tagname may exist for a single food
          item if the values were calculated
          from the proximate components using
          different conversion factors.)

          (7 x g alcohol)

      If none of the above keywords apply,
          the actual conversion factors used to
          calculate the total metabolizable
          energy should be listed using the
          following secondary tagnames:
      <XP>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from protein
      <XCT>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from total
          carbohydrate
      <XCA>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from available
          carbohydrate
      <XF>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from fat
      <XA>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from alcohol
      <XO>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from organic acid
      Note: If these secondary tagnames are
          used, conversion factors for <XP> and
          <XF> are required; a conversion
          factor for either <XCT> or <XCA> is
          required; and conversion factors for
          <XA> and <XO> are optional.

      <ENERC> may not be used without either one
          of the keywords specified above or a set
          of specific conversion factors (or both). 
          If the conversion system and factors are
          unknown, <ENER-> should be used.
      Examples: The 76 kcal/100 g energy value
          for whole cow's milk in the Ethiopian food
          table was calculated from proximate values
          using conversion factors from the USDA
          Agriculture Handbook No. 8.  Therefore,
          the energy value would be listed using the
          <ENERC> tagname and the USDA keyword, with
          the kilocalorie unit stated with the
          secondary tagname <UNIT/> to replace the
          default unit of kilojoules:
               <ENERC> 76 USDA <UNIT/> kcal </UNIT/>
               </ENERC>

          The 272 kJ/100 g energy value for fresh,
          whole cow's milk in the McCance and
          Widdowson food table was calculated with
         the kilojoule conversion factors that use
          available carbohydrate.  Therefore, the
          energy value would be listed using the
          <ENERC> tagname and the KJA keyword:
               <ENERC> 272 KJA </ENERC>

          If an energy value expressed in
          kilocalories were calculated for whole
          cow's milk using conversion factors for
          protein, fat, and total carbohydrate, and
          these conversion factors did not conform
          to any of the factors described by the
          available keywords, the energy value would
          be listed using the <ENERC> tagname and
          the <XP>, <XF> and <XCT> secondary
          tagnames.  The kilocalorie unit would be
          stated with the secondary tagname <UNIT/>
          to replace the default unit of kilojoules:
               <ENERC> 76.42 <XP> 4.3 <XF> 8.8 <XCT> 3.9
               <UNIT/> kcal </UNIT/> </ENERC>
      Note: In these examples, </UNIT/> and
          </ENERC> are end-tags required in
          interchange format to indicate the end of
          the unit and energy information.  See the
          INFOODS Data Interchange Handbook for
          details on interchange format.

<ENER->   energy; method of determination
          unknown or variable
      Unit: kJ.  The value for <ENER-> may
          be expressed in kilocalories instead
          of the default unit of kilojoules.
          However, if expressed in
          kilocalories, kcal must be explicitly
          stated with the secondary tagname
          <UNIT/>.
      Note: It would be confusing and would
          imply additional information that
          does not exist if two <ENER-> values,
          i.e., one expressed in kilocalories
          and the other expressed in
          kilojoules, were included for a
          single food item when one value has
          simply been calculated from the other
          using the conversion equation: 1 kcal
          = 4.184 kJ.  Consequently, one or the
          other should be used, but not both.
     Synonyms: kilojoules; kilocalories;
     Calories; food energy
      Comments: The <ENER-> tagname should
          be used if it is not known whether
          the energy value represents gross
          energy or total metabolizable energy. 
          It should also be used if it is known
          that the energy value was calculated
          from the proximate components but the
          conversion factors used are unknown. 
          (It is meaningless to have <ENER-> in
          combination with either <ENERA> or
          <ENERC> for a given food item.)
