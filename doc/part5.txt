          keyword identifying the animal used

          available for identifying the animal
          in which the biological experiments
          were conducted:
     MAN  experiments conducted with human

<AALC>
     limiting amino acid; determined through
     calculation
      Unit: None  (The use of <UNIT/> is
          prohibited with this tagname since no unit
          is required for its value.)
      Comments: The limiting amino acid is
          determined by comparing the quantity of
          each essential amino acid in the food to
          the quantity of the same amino acid in a
          reference protein or amino acid mixture. 
          The amino acid found in the lowest ratio
          is the limiting amino acid.
          Two data items are associated with
          tagname <AALB>.  The first is the tagname
          of the limiting amino acid; the second is
          a keyword identifying the reference
          protein or amino acid pattern used in
          calculation of the chemical (amino acid)
          score.
      Keywords: The keywords to designate the
          reference pattern are identical to those
          for the chemical score.  See tagname
          <CHEMSC> on page 37.
     Tables: EA
      Example: In the FAO Food Composition Table
          for Use in East Asia, lysine is listed as
          the limiting amino acid in sesame seeds. 
          This determination was made through
          calculations of chemical score using
          the FAO reference protein pattern
          recommended in 1973.  Therefore, the
          <AALC> tagname would be used to
          convey this information in the
          following manner:
               <AALC> LYS FAO73 </AALC>
      Note: In this example, </AALC> is an
          end-tag required in interchange
          format to indicate the end of the
          information about the limiting amino
          acid.  See the INFOODS Data
          Interchange Handbook for details on
          interchange format.

          prohibited with this tagname since no unit
          is required.)
     Synonyms: protein score, amino acid score
      Comments: Chemical score is the ratio of
          the quantity of the limiting amino acid in

          acid in the protein of egg or a standard
          amino acid reference mixture.
      Keywords: Three data items are associated
          with the tagname <CHEMSC>: the calculated
          chemical score, a keyword to identify the
          reference protein or amino acid mixture
          that was used in determining the chemical
          score, and an optional second keyword to
          indicate the basis of the calculation. 
          The available values of the first keyword
          are:
      EGG  egg protein, as described by Block and
          Mitchell (?) or an equivalent method.

          on human amino acid requirements and
          suggested by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert
          Committee on Energy and Protein
          Requirements in 1973 (?)
      Note: Additional keywords will be
          added as reference mixtures are
          defined and used in food composition
          data bases.
      Keywords: If it is known whether the
          calculation is based on values
          determined with respect to total
          protein or with respect to total
          nitrogen, this can be specified with
          an additional keyword, whose possible
          values are:
      N  values calculated per gram of
          nitrogen in test mixture
      P  values calculated per gram of
          protein in test mixture

          0.58 x 100).  The value was
          calculated using the 1973 FAO
          reference protein pattern.  This
