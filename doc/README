`mysql-schema.sql' is the table schema for MySQL. `mysql-*' is the minimum data
for some of the tables, so that the application can work.

`food-create.sql' and `food-drop.sql' is an attempt to make database tables for
PostgreSQL. If the tables are set up properly, I assume they should be
accessible without any change in code, thanks to lib/adodb.

`all' and `part?.txt' is a list of all nutrient types. I don't remember where I
found this list.
