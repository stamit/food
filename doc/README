`mysql-schema.sql' is the table schema for MySQL. `mysql-*' is the minimum data
for some of the tables, so that the application can work.

`food-create.sql' and `food-drop.sql' is an attempt to make database tables for
PostgreSQL. If the tables are set up properly, I assume they should be
accessible without any change in code, thanks to lib/adodb.

`all' and `part?.txt' is a list of all INFOODS nutrients.

The contents of `usda-sr25.txt' come from the PDF in the USDA nutrient database
distribution from this URL:

	http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=22771

`usda-import.py' is a Python script that will take the `usda-sr25.txt' file (or
any named file) and produce SQL statements for MySQL or PostreSQL that will
create and fill the database tables. Run this script from the directory where
you extracted the ZIP file from the above URL. For example, if you extracted
the ZIP in directory `sr25' under this directory (doc) and you are using MySQL
database `usda', then this should work:

	cd sr25
	python ../usda-import.py <../usda-sr25.txt | mysql usda
