`mysql-schema.sql' is the table schema for MySQL. `mysql-*' is the minimum data
for some of the tables, so that the application can work.

`food-create.sql' and `food-drop.sql' is an attempt to make database tables for
PostgreSQL. If the tables are set up properly, I assume they should be
accessible without any change in code, thanks to lib/adodb.

`all' and `part?.txt' is a list of all INFOODS nutrients.

The contents of `usda-sr25.txt' come from the PDF in the USDA nutrient database
distribution from this URL:

	http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=22771

`usda-import' is a Python script that will take the `usda-sr25.txt' file (or
any named file) and produce SQL statements for MySQL or PostreSQL (warning:
this is untested) that will create and fill the database tables. It uses any
UPPERCASE_TABLE.txt files it can find in the current working directory as data
inputs for INSERTING:

	cd sr25
	../usda-import ../usda-sr25.txt | mysql usda

`usda-export-mysql' will connect to your MySQL database and output the schema
in the same USDA format that the above script will read. This command will
connect to MySQL on localhost, use database "food", and read from tables with
prefix "usda_" (which it will discard):

	./usda-export-mysql //localhost/food/usda_ >current-schema.txt

If you give `usda-import' two schema arguments A and B, it will output the SQL
statements for ALTERing the database tables (ADDing, MODIFYing and DROPping
columns as well as CREATEing and DROPping tables as needed) so that a database
with schema A will be converted to schema B. If the first argument is '-', it
will read the first file from stdin. This way you can pipe the output of
`usda-export-mysql' directly to `usda-import'. For example, this command will
update the `usda_...' tables in the `food' database on localhost to match the
description in `usda-sr25.txt':

	../usda-export-mysql food | ../usda-import - usda-sr25.txt | mysql food

INSERT statements will be generated only if there exist files named
UPPERCASETABLENAME.txt in the current working directory.
