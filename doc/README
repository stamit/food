`mysql-schema.sql' is the table schema for MySQL. `mysql-*' is the minimum data
for some of the tables, so that the application can work. Import these files
into a new database.

`food-create.sql' and `food-drop.sql' is an attempt to make database tables for
PostgreSQL. If the tables are set up properly, I assume they should be
accessible without any change in code, thanks to lib/adodb.

`INFOODS' is a list of all INFOODS nutrient tags.

The contents of `usda-sr25.txt' come from the PDF in the USDA nutrient database
distribution from this URL:

schema-from-mysql
=================

`schema-from-mysql' will connect to your MySQL database and output the table
descriptions in USDA-like format.

To export the current table descriptions of the whole "food" database on
localhost, do this:

	./schema-from-mysql food >current-schema.txt

Or this:

	./schema-from-mysql //localhost/food >current-schema.txt

To export only the tables whose name starts with "usda_":

	./schema-from-mysql food/usda_ >current-schema.txt


schema-to-sql
=============

`schema-to-sql' will take a schema file (such as SCHEMA or `usda-sr25.txt') and
produce SQL statements for creating and and filling the database tables. It
uses any UPPERCASE_TABLE.txt files it can find in the current working directory
as data for INSERTing (again in USDA format).

If you give `schema-to-sql' two schema arguments A and B, it will output the
SQL statements for ALTERing the database tables (ADDing, MODIFYing and DROPping
columns as well as CREATEing and DROPping tables as needed) so that a database
with schema A will be converted to schema B. If the first argument is '-', it
will read the first file from stdin.

To update your local database "food" after getting a new version of this code:

	./schema-from-mysql food | ./schema-to-sql - SCHEMA | mysql food

To import the USDA data into the "food" database on localhost when all tables
have already been created:

	mkdir sr25
	cd sr25
	unzip ~/sr25.zip
	../schema-to-sql usda_ ../usda-sr25.txt ../usda-sr25.txt | mysql usda

To create the database tables when they do not already exist, you would use:

	../schema-to-sql usda_ /dev/null ../usda-sr25.txt | mysql usda
