          amino acids because they are essential for
          infants.

<AAE10B>amino acids, total essential; includes
               the eight basic essential amino acids
               plus cystine and tyrosine
      Unit: mg
      Comments: Cystine and tyrosine are
          included in this definition of
          essential amino acids because of
          their sparing effects on the
          requirements for methionine and
          phenylalanine respectively.

          reported, they are usually the sum of
          whatever amino acids were analysed for
          that particular food.  Consequently, this
          term is not precisely defined.  Additional

<ENERA>
     energy, gross; determined by direct

          expressed in kilocalories instead of the
          default unit of kilojoules. However, if
          expressed in kilocalories, kcal must be
          explicitly stated with the secondary
          tagname <UNIT/>.
      Note: It would be confusing and would imply
          additional information that does not exist
          if two <ENERA> values, i.e., one expressed
          in kilocalories and the other expressed in

          may be described by a keyword, or the
          conversion factors may be listed
          using secondary tagnames within
          <ENERC>.  (More than one <ENERC>
          tagname may exist for a single food
          item if the values were calculated
          from the proximate components using
          different conversion factors.)

          the actual conversion factors used to
          calculate the total metabolizable
          energy should be listed using the
          following secondary tagnames:
      <XP>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from protein
      <XCT>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from total
          carbohydrate
      <XCA>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from available
          carbohydrate
      <XF>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from fat
      <XA>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from alcohol
      <XO>  conversion factor for
          calculating energy from organic acid
      Note: If these secondary tagnames are
          used, conversion factors for <XP> and
          <XF> are required; a conversion
          factor for either <XCT> or <XCA> is
          required; and conversion factors for
          <XA> and <XO> are optional.

      <ENERC> may not be used without either one
          of the keywords specified above or a set
          of specific conversion factors (or both). 
          If the conversion system and factors are
          unknown, <ENER-> should be used.
      Examples: The 76 kcal/100 g energy value
          for whole cow's milk in the Ethiopian food
          table was calculated from proximate values
          using conversion factors from the USDA
          Agriculture Handbook No. 8.  Therefore,
          the energy value would be listed using the
          <ENERC> tagname and the USDA keyword, with
          the kilocalorie unit stated with the
          secondary tagname <UNIT/> to replace the
          default unit of kilojoules:
               <ENERC> 76 USDA <UNIT/> kcal </UNIT/>
               </ENERC>

          The 272 kJ/100 g energy value for fresh,
          whole cow's milk in the McCance and
          Widdowson food table was calculated with
         the kilojoule conversion factors that use
          available carbohydrate.  Therefore, the
          energy value would be listed using the
          <ENERC> tagname and the KJA keyword:
               <ENERC> 272 KJA </ENERC>

          If an energy value expressed in
          kilocalories were calculated for whole
          cow's milk using conversion factors for
          protein, fat, and total carbohydrate, and
          these conversion factors did not conform
          to any of the factors described by the
          available keywords, the energy value would
          be listed using the <ENERC> tagname and
          the <XP>, <XF> and <XCT> secondary
          tagnames.  The kilocalorie unit would be
          stated with the secondary tagname <UNIT/>
          to replace the default unit of kilojoules:
               <ENERC> 76.42 <XP> 4.3 <XF> 8.8 <XCT> 3.9
               <UNIT/> kcal </UNIT/> </ENERC>
      Note: In these examples, </UNIT/> and
          </ENERC> are end-tags required in
          interchange format to indicate the end of
          the unit and energy information.  See the
          INFOODS Data Interchange Handbook for
          details on interchange format.

<ENER->   energy; method of determination
          unknown or variable
      Unit: kJ.  The value for <ENER-> may
          be expressed in kilocalories instead
          of the default unit of kilojoules.
          However, if expressed in
          kilocalories, kcal must be explicitly
          stated with the secondary tagname
          <UNIT/>.
      Note: It would be confusing and would
          imply additional information that
          does not exist if two <ENER-> values,
          i.e., one expressed in kilocalories
          and the other expressed in
          kilojoules, were included for a
          single food item when one value has
          simply been calculated from the other
          using the conversion equation: 1 kcal
          = 4.184 kJ.  Consequently, one or the
          other should be used, but not both.
     Synonyms: kilojoules; kilocalories;
     Calories; food energy
      Comments: The <ENER-> tagname should
          be used if it is not known whether
          the energy value represents gross
          energy or total metabolizable energy. 
          It should also be used if it is known
          that the energy value was calculated
          from the proximate components but the
          conversion factors used are unknown. 
          (It is meaningless to have <ENER-> in
          combination with either <ENERA> or
          <ENERC> for a given food item.)

          nitrogen.  <PROCNT> is the appropriate
          tagname for total protein in most cases.

<PROCNP>
     protein, total; calculated from protein
     nitrogen
     Unit: g
      Comments: Two pieces of data are associated
          with the tagname <PROCNP>.  The first is
          the quantity of total protein and the
          second is the conversion factor used to
          calculate total protein from protein
          nitrogen.
      Note: The total protein found in food
          tables is rarely calculated from protein
          nitrogen. <PROCNT> is the appropriate
          tagname for total protein in most cases.

<PROCNT>
     protein, total; calculated from total
     nitrogen
     Unit: g
      Comments: Three pieces of data are
          associated with the tagname <PROCNT>.  The
          first is the quantity of total protein;
          the second is a keyword which identifies
          the source of the conversion factor used
          to calculate the total protein from total
          nitrogen; and the third is the actual
          conversion factor used.  If possible, all
          three pieces of data should be included
          with <PROCNT>.  However, it is acceptable
          to include only the keyword or the
          conversion factor (rather than both) with
          the total protein value if one or the
          other is unknown.  If the conversion
          factor used was generated from a source
          other than one of those identified by the
          available keywords, the conversion factor
          should be listed without any keyword
          information.
      Keywords: Following are the available
          keywords that can be used as the
          second value for the <PROCNT>
          tagname:
     JONES  conversion factor originally
     derived by Jones (?)
     Tables: EGP, NE, EA
      FAO  conversion factor from a table in
          the FAO Nutritional Studies No. 24
          (?), reprinted in the World Health
          Organization Technical Report Series
          No. 522 (?)
     Tables: MW, DAN
      USDA  conversion factor from a table
          in the United States Department of
          Agriculture Handbook No. 8 (?)
     Tables: USDA 203
      STD  standard conversion factor of
          6.25, not specific for the type of
          food.  (If this keyword is used, the
          6.25 conversion factor should not be
          listed with the secondary tagname
          <XN>.)
     Tables: SFK, IND, PRC

      The following secondary tagname may be
          used to identify the specific
          conversion factor used when a keyword
          other than STD is present, or instead
          of a keyword (see above).
      <XN>  conversion factor for
          calculating total protein from total
          nitrogen
      Examples: The 3.2 g/100 g of protein
          in cow's milk which is listed in the
          Nutritive Value of Indian Foods was
          calculated from total nitrogen using
          the 6.25 conversion factor. 
          Therefore, the protein value would be
          listed using the <PROCNT> tagname and
          the STD keyword:
               <PROCNT> 3.2 STD </PROCNT>

          The 3.3 g/100 g of protein in cow's milk
          which is listed in McCance and Widdowson
          was calculated from total nitrogen using a
          6.38 conversion factor.  This factor was
          obtained from the FAO publication. 
          Therefore, the protein value would be
          listed using the <PROCNT> tagname, the FAO
          keyword, and the <XN> secondary tagname:
               <PROCNT> 3.3 FAO <XN> 6.38 </PROCNT>

          As a hypothetical example, if a value of
          0.3 g/100 g of protein in watermelon seeds
          were calculated from total nitrogen using
          the conversion factor 5.30, and this value
          had not been taken from one of the tables
          identified by the list of keywords, the
          protein value would be listed using the
          <PROCNT> tagname in the following manner:
               <PROCNT> 0.3 <XN> 5.30 </PROCNT>
      Note: In these examples, </PROCNT> is an
          end-tag required in interchange format to
          indicate the end of the information about
          protein calculated from total nitrogen. 
          See the INFOODS Data Interchange Handbook
          for details on interchange format.

<PRO->
     protein, total; method of determination
     unknown or variable
     Unit: g
      Comments: The <PRO-> tagname should be used
          for a total protein value when it is not
          known whether the value was the result of
          a direct analysis or whether it was
          calculated from total nitrogen, protein
          nitrogen, or amino nitrogen.  The <PRO->
          tagname should also be used if it is known
          that the total protein value was
          calculated from one of the nitrogen
          components, but the conversion factor used
          in the calculation is unknown.

      Unit: mcg.  The value for <VITA> may
          be expressed in international units
          instead of the default unit of
          micrograms.  International units are
          not preferred; however, if they are
          used, IU must be explicitly stated
          with the secondary tagname <UNIT/>.
      Note: It would be confusing and would
          imply additional information that
          does not exist if two <VITA> values,
          i.e., one expressed in mcg and the
          other expressed in IU, were included
          for a single food item when one value
          has simply been calculated from the
          other using the following conversion
          equation:  1 retinol equivalent =
          3.33 IU vitamin A activity from
          retinol = 10 IU vitamin A activity
          from beta-carotene.  Consequently,
          one or the other should be used, but
          not both.

          however, if they are used, IU must be
          explicitly stated with the secondary
          tagname <UNIT/>.
       Comments: The <VITA-> tagname should be

          i.e., one expressed in mcg and the
          other expressed in IU, were included
          for a single food item when one value
          has simply been calculated from the
          other using the conversion equation:
          1 mcg vitamin D = 40 IU. 
          Consequently, one or the other should
          be used, but not both.

     Tables: MW

<VITD->
     vitamin D; method of determination unknown
          or variable
      Unit: mcg.  The value for <VITD-> may be
          expressed in international units instead
          of the default unit of micrograms. 
          International units are not preferred;
          however, if they are used, IU must be
          explicitly stated with the secondary
          tagname <UNIT/>.
      Note: It would be confusing and would imply
          additional information that does not exist
          if two <VITD-> values, i.e., one expressed
          in mcg and the other expressed in IU, were
          included for a single food item when one
          value has simply been calculated from the
          other using the conversion equation: 1 mcg
          vitamin D = 40 IU.  Consequently, one or
          the other should be used, but not both.
      Comments: The <VITD-> tagname should be
          used if it is not known whether the
          vitamin D value was determined by bioassay
          or by calculation.  

<VITE>
      vitamin E; calculated by summation of the
          vitamin E activities of the active
          tocopherols and tocotrienols; expressed as
          alpha-tocopherol equivalents
      Unit: mg.  The value for <VITE> may be
          expressed in international units instead
          of the default unit of milligrams. 
          International units are not preferred;
          however, if they are used, IU must be
          explicitly stated with the secondary
          tagname <UNIT/>.
      Note: It would be confusing and would imply
          additional information that does not exist
          if two <VITE> values, i.e., one expressed
          in mg and the other expressed in IU, were
          included for a single food item when one
          value has simply been calculated from the
          other using the conversion equation: 1 mg
          alpha-tocopherol equivalents = 1.49 IU. 
          Consequently, one or the other should be
          used, but not both.
      Comments: In addition to a value for the
          quantity of vitamin E expressed as alpha-
          tocopherol equivalents, <VITE> includes a
          description or listing of the conversion
          factors used to calculate this
          vitamin E value from the active
          tocopherols and tocotrienols.  The
          conversion factors may be described
          by a keyword or may be listed using
          secondary tagnames within <VITE>. 
          (More than one <VITE> tagname may
          exist for a single food item if the
          values were calculated from the
          active tocopherols and tocotrienols
          using different conversion factors.)

      If none of the above keywords apply, the
          actual conversion factors used to
          calculate vitamin E should be listed using
          the following secondary tagnames:
          <XATP> alpha-tocopherol conversion factor
          <XBTP> beta-tocopherol conversion factor
          <XGTP> gamma-tocopherol conversion factor

          for fresh, whole cow's milk in the McCance
          and Widdowson food table represents alpha-
          tocopherol only.  Consequently, the value
          0.10 would be shown with the <TOCPHA>
          tagname, not the <VITE> tagname and the
          associated keyword:
               <TOCPHA> 0.10 </TOCPHA>

          If a vitamin E value of 0.12, expressed in
          alpha-tocopherol equivalents, were
          calculated for whole cow's milk from the
          alpha-tocopherol, beta-tocopherol, gamma-
          tocopherol, and alpha-tocotrienol values,
          and the conversion factors used did not
          conform to any of the factors described by
          the available keywords, the vitamin E
          value would be listed using the <VITE>
          tagname and the <XBTP>, <XGTP>, and <XATT>
          secondary tagnames:
               <VITE> 0.12 <XBTP> 0.4 <XGTP> 0.1 <XATT>
               0.25 </VITE>

          keyword identifying the animal used
          in the biological experiments which
          determined the limiting amino acid.
      Keywords: The following keywords are
          available for identifying the animal
          in which the biological experiments
          were conducted:
     MAN  experiments conducted with human
     subjects
     RAT  experiments conducted with rats

<AALC>
     limiting amino acid; determined through
     calculation
      Unit: None  (The use of <UNIT/> is
          prohibited with this tagname since no unit
          is required for its value.)
      Comments: The limiting amino acid is
          determined by comparing the quantity of
          each essential amino acid in the food to
          the quantity of the same amino acid in a
          reference protein or amino acid mixture. 
          The amino acid found in the lowest ratio
          is the limiting amino acid.
          Two data items are associated with
          tagname <AALB>.  The first is the tagname
          of the limiting amino acid; the second is
          a keyword identifying the reference
          protein or amino acid pattern used in
          calculation of the chemical (amino acid)
          score.
      Keywords: The keywords to designate the
          reference pattern are identical to those
          for the chemical score.  See tagname
          <CHEMSC> on page 37.
     Tables: EA
      Example: In the FAO Food Composition Table
          for Use in East Asia, lysine is listed as
          the limiting amino acid in sesame seeds. 
          This determination was made through
          calculations of chemical score using
          the FAO reference protein pattern
          recommended in 1973.  Therefore, the
          <AALC> tagname would be used to
          convey this information in the
          following manner:
               <AALC> LYS FAO73 </AALC>
      Note: In this example, </AALC> is an
          end-tag required in interchange
          format to indicate the end of the
          information about the limiting amino
          acid.  See the INFOODS Data
          Interchange Handbook for details on

          prohibited with this tagname since no unit
          is required.)
     Synonyms: protein score, amino acid score
      Comments: Chemical score is the ratio of
          the quantity of the limiting amino acid in
          the food per quantity of this same amino
          acid in the protein of egg or a standard
          amino acid reference mixture.
      Keywords: Three data items are associated
          with the tagname <CHEMSC>: the calculated
          chemical score, a keyword to identify the
          reference protein or amino acid mixture
          that was used in determining the chemical
          score, and an optional second keyword to
          indicate the basis of the calculation. 
          The available values of the first keyword
          are:
      EGG  egg protein, as described by Block and
          Mitchell (?) or an equivalent method.
      MILK  human milk protein
      FAO57  reference protein pattern based
          on human amino acid requirements and
          recommended by FAO in 1957 (?)
      FAO65  reference protein pattern based
          on egg protein and suggested by the
          Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on
          Energy and Protein Requirements in
          1965 (?)
      FAO73  reference protein pattern based
          on human amino acid requirements and
          suggested by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert
          Committee on Energy and Protein
          Requirements in 1973 (?)
      Note: Additional keywords will be
          added as reference mixtures are
          defined and used in food composition
          data bases.
      Keywords: If it is known whether the
          calculation is based on values
          determined with respect to total
          protein or with respect to total
          nitrogen, this can be specified with
          an additional keyword, whose possible
          values are:
      N  values calculated per gram of
          nitrogen in test mixture
      P  values calculated per gram of
          protein in test mixture
     See chapter 3 of Pellett and Young (?)
     for additional discussion.

      Example: In the FAO Food Composition
          Table For Use in East Asia, the
          chemical score for sesame seeds is
          listed as 58 (this is a percentage:
          0.58 x 100).  The value was
          calculated using the 1973 FAO
          reference protein pattern.  This
          information would be conveyed using
          the <CHEMSC> tagname in the following
          manner:
               <CHEMSC> 0.58 FAO73 </CHEMSC>
      Note: In this example, </CHEMSC> is an
          end-tag required in interchange
          format to indicate the end of the
          chemical score information.  See the
          INFOODS Data Interchange Handbook for

      Comment: Determined by dividing total
          nitrogen by total protein.  In most
          cases, if <PROCNT> (cf.) is used with
          the <XN> subtag (for documentation
          purposes there), this value will be
          the same as the <XN> value.

     Synonyms: NPU
      Comments: Net protein utilization is the
          proportion of nitrogen intake that is
          retained.  This value is the product of
          digestibility and the proportion of
          absorbed nitrogen that is retained
          (biological value).
      Keywords: The tagname <NPU> requires two
          data items: the NPU value and a keyword
          identifying the animal used to
          experimentally determine digestiblity and
          biological value.  The available keywords
          are:
